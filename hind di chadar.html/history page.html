    <h2>Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji: A Concise Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji [Wednesday, April 18, 1621 â€“ Wednesday, November 24, 1675], revered as Srisht-di-Chadar (Protector of humanity), was the ninth Guru of the Sikhs. He became Guru on 16 April 1664, succeeding his grand-nephew and the eighth Guru, Guru Har Krishan Ji.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poet, thinker, and warrior, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji continued the spiritual legacy of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and the earlier Sikh Gurus. He wrote 116 hymns addressing topics like the nature of God, human attachments, dignity, service, and deliverance, which are included in the sacred Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guru Ji traveled throughout the Indian subcontinent to spread Sikh teachings and established new preaching centers. He founded Chak-Nanki in Punjab, which was later developed into the city of Sri Anandpur Sahib by Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 1675, Hindu Pandits from Kashmir sought Guru Jiâ€™s help against forced conversions to Islam under the Mughal rulers. Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji defended religious freedom, refused to convert to Islam himself, and was publicly executed by beheading in Delhi on Emperor Aurangzebâ€™s orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib and Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib in Delhi now mark the sites of his beheading and cremation. Three Sikhsâ€”Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Sati Das, and Bhai Dyal Dasâ€”were also executed with him.
